# THESIS

This repository contains the source code for the simulation software in the `src` folder, as well as the presentation in the `presentation` folder.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to share the main results from my Ph.D. study. The simulation software in the `src` folder allows users to play around the adaptive sampling system, tweek the parameters and then see the behaviours of the system. The `presentation` folder contains the presentation in the `phd.html` file, which provides an overview of adaptive sampling using underwater robots.

## Public distribution
The simulation software can be accessed at 

To view the presentation, open the `phd.html` file located in the `presentation` folder in a web browser.
